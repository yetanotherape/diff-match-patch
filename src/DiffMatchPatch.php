/**
 * Functions for diff, match and patch.
 *
 * Computes the difference between two texts to create a patch. Applies the patch onto another text,
 * allowing for errors.
 * This class implements the same API as all other google-diff-match-patch libs. It was created for
 * compatibility reason only.
 *
 * @property float Diff_Timeout          Number of seconds to map a diff before giving up (0 for infinity).
 * @property int   Diff_EditCost         Cost of an empty edit operation in terms of edit characters.
 * @property float Match_Threshold       At what point is no match declared (0.0 = perfection, 1.0 = very loose).
 * @property int   Match_Distance        How far to search for a match (0 = exact location, 1000+ = broad match).
 *                                       A match this many characters away from the expected location will add
 *                                       1.0 to the score (0.0 is a perfect match).
 * @property int   Match_MaxBits         The number of bits in an int.
 * @property float Patch_DeleteThreshold When deleting a large block of text (over ~64 characters), how close do
 *                                       the contents have to be to match the expected contents. (0.0 = perfection,
 *                                       1.0 = very loose).  Note that Match_Threshold controls how closely the
 *                                       end points of a delete need to match.
 * @property int   Patch_Margin          Chunk size for context length.
